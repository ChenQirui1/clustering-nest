net.kervala.comicsreader,Perfect for Nook Color After downloading failed applications for two hours  Comics Reader finally proved it can read a comic book file extension on old technology like Nook Color. This is huge to see an app like this be so backwards compatible. Keep it up guys. You have won my fandom.,November 05 2016,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Fast and smooth,September 24 2016,4

net.kervala.comicsreader,Another app screwed by an update,August 25 2016,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,"Please fix the scaling problem? The latest update has a problem with scaling the images. Now  no matter what I have the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""fit to"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option set to  I still have to manually scroll up  down  right and left to see the whole image. It doesn't seem like it  but believe me it's very annoying.""""",April 13 2016,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,I don't like the new update,April 12 2016,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,Scaling broken Today's update broke the scaling down to height/width  now I need to move the image up/down  left/right to see all  otherwise a great reader. Hope it gets fixed soon.,April 12 2016,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,Comics I love this app BUT after today's update my comics won't go to full screen. They go bigger and I have to move the page atriums to read it and see the whole thing. I would rate it a 5 if it wasn't for that.,April 12 2016,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,Why don't u add an app icon?,April 11 2016,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,The best one I use it everytime I read a comic.,April 11 2016,5

net.kervala.comicsreader,Can't zoom,February 09 2016,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,Works great but... This is nearly perfect. The one downside? It can't find comics on my SD card. If this isn't an issue for you  then it's perfect.,January 25 2016,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Cannot zoom (too small) On LG G2,January 20 2016,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,Underrated. Prefer it to apps that are rated for other reasons: full screen page  swipe to turn page  crisp & clear  no ads. What more do you need?,January 16 2016,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Nice!,January 15 2016,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Clean and simple! No unneeded interface elements. Easy to configure!,January 09 2016,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Lacks Pinch Zoom Seriously  it has no glitches but that's the one flaw it has: you have to change zoom through the settings. Otherwise great  legit comic reader,December 03 2015,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Nice,November 14 2015,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Smooth and easy Its the perfect comic/manga reader ever,November 14 2015,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Doesn't open big files I have a file that is a little bigger than 1 gb and it crashes when opening. Delete function would be cool as well.,November 07 2015,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Not working,November 03 2015,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,Horrible Yeah right. Try better next time. You can't even zoom. Completely rubbish,September 27 2015,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,Almost perfect Please add zoom buttons or pinch to zoom,September 22 2015,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,I can't use it What's with these Comic reader Apps. I can access movies/music/YouTube/ect... But I can't access Google books  aka the comics I bought and paid for. The only reason I downloaded this was so I could read the Comic like I could with the DC/Marvel/Dark Horse app but I guess I was asking too much.,September 12 2015,2
net.kervala.comicsreader,Zoom I cant zoom or the feature hasnt been added.,September 03 2015,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,No interface at all. Opening app just opens a file browser in the comic reader directory. There is no interface at all.,September 02 2015,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,Pls add zoom function,August 16 2015,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,5 Super,July 22 2015,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,"I love the simple interface But it would be handy to have """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Delete"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" comics function in the app with support for deleting comics inside SD card. Also a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Zoom Pinch"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" function is much needed. I'm okay with occasional crashes.""""",July 18 2015,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,It's nice Can't zoom (need to use settings) and everytime I go to the end of a page it goes to the next page... Please fix it I'll rate it 5 when its fixed,July 13 2015,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,Big issues Can't zoom in/out when reading pages are not centered.can't go to next page and sometimes it gets stuck in the middle of both pages.,July 06 2015,2
net.kervala.comicsreader,Kajsjs Shehe,June 18 2015,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Almost there Buggy page turning  no pinch zooming. However  what is making me start looking for other is that it was reading the contents in the wrong order for this last book.,June 17 2015,2
net.kervala.comicsreader,Very nice This is the best one I've tried so far. The only issue is that the screen sometimes flickers as you scroll or turn pages. I can live with that.,June 13 2015,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,5/5 Best comic reader i've used  doesn't crash randomly and doesn't stop showing pages randomly like other ones.,June 04 2015,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Unable to access external memory Unable to access external memory,April 25 2015,2
net.kervala.comicsreader,Would not load past first image,April 13 2015,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,Loading of next page is a bit funny otherwise fine,April 03 2015,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,nice app,March 28 2015,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Awesome app  easily used.. Would recommend it to everyone,March 20 2015,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Crashfest Installed. Crashed twice. Uninstalled,March 13 2015,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,Lacks multi touch zoom Some comic panels require zooming in. Kindly add that feature.,February 17 2015,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,Amazing but needs fixing The app is amazing but after the last update  the app don't open comics anymore and closes itself. It's annoying really!!,February 04 2015,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,Good app I really like it. Nice  Clean simple. The no pinch To zoom is a deal breaker for me though. Perhaps in a future update? I'll try a few more apps . Maybe give this one another look at a later time..,January 30 2015,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,Best app to read comics Try it.,January 13 2015,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,I love this app I am able to search my files to find any comic book I have and read it,January 11 2015,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,"Could be better  Need some work Would be pretty all right if there was a proper """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""pinch to zoom"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ability  and the page turning wasn't so buggy. Also  the app seems to get attached to particular pages of a comic  and always want to resume to the same spot  even if you were much further along when you last closed the app.""""",January 09 2015,2
net.kervala.comicsreader,Cool Super fun and they have the best comics,January 02 2015,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Zoom Was not able to zoom in on a frame,December 25 2014,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,Cool This application is awsome!,December 16 2014,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,"Came back to this after trying ComicRack I actually tried Comic Rack (Paid version) and didn't like it  so I went back to this one. This reader has a simple interface. ComicRack's interface actually made it hard to read and enjoy a comic. Every time I tried to go to the next page  it zooms in. Although Comics Reader doesn't have a zoom function (minus 1 star)  it's fine with me. I just switched from my 7"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tablet to my 10"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tablet. I may try out Challenger Comics Viewer and see if it's better.""""",November 21 2014,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Great Almost perfect. Only one issue. Doesn't work in landscape mode. Glitches and the screen pops to black on and off. Otherwise amazing app.,November 19 2014,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,It works Awesome,October 30 2014,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Not Perfect  But Good Enough,September 08 2014,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Most frustrating App does not work well at all. Doesnt find your comic files but makes you find them and sometimes doesn't even show them at all. When trying to flip a page sometimes it will flip to the same page your on a dozen times or so  fix for this is exit the app  reload it  find the comic  find the page and hope it doesn't happen again. It oftentimes will. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.,September 08 2014,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,Clean  but missing important features Overall I like the clean UI but it is missing some important features like zooming and some basic library functionality. I'd like to set a default location for my comic files and a way to mark comic books as (un)read.,September 03 2014,2
net.kervala.comicsreader,Best I like this app super,August 31 2014,5
net.kervala.comicsreader,Gets the job done  but nothing fancy No zoom is a bit frustrating. When I create a bookmark and then later try to use the bookmark to go back to where I was  it crashes. If I go to a different app and then later go back to this one  it starts from the beginning like I opened the file for the first time. Might need to look for a better comic reader... Just found Challenger Comics Viewer....much better. Truth.,August 28 2014,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,Can't zoom,August 24 2014,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,Has potential Touch sensitivity is awful  lack of options  no zoom.,August 21 2014,2
net.kervala.comicsreader,Sux Uninstalled,August 19 2014,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,Can't zoom Why can't you zoom in  some text can hardly be seen and its worse on a duble page. It's the only problem I have come across but its kinda a biggie As it means having to read those pages on another comic reader that can zoom but crashes every other page.,August 10 2014,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,It works. Didn't care for it all that much though. Wasnt very touch sensitive. Had to try 2 or 3 times to get it to respond. Note 2.,August 09 2014,2
net.kervala.comicsreader,Not working When I select the comic the screen goes right back to my book list.,August 05 2014,1

net.kervala.comicsreader,Worth it if comic lover,July 27 2014,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Good app. Would like pinch and zoom though,July 23 2014,3
net.kervala.comicsreader,Awesome app! Overall pretty good app. Has alot of awesome settings. Would love to see double tap and pinch to zoom features and some improvements on the UI: like a book self and a recently books read list etc. But even now i believe its better from the most paid readers and all of the free ones!! Will give it 5 if some of the features i mention going to be added later on :),July 21 2014,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Good App! Overall a good app. Nice compatibility with different book file types. User interface could be a bit better. Reminds a little of the older days with dos but it works. I can read my DeadPool Comics and D&D books. Keep it up!,July 20 2014,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Add zoom..,July 19 2014,3

net.kervala.comicsreader,Doesnt work,June 30 2014,1
net.kervala.comicsreader,One of the best!!! Certainly  given its small size and ease of use i must say its one of the most bestest apps out there and i will surely give it a five star rating if u add a pinch zoom feature in it! Thanx!,June 24 2014,4

net.kervala.comicsreader,Great reader This really is a good reader. I've tried 3 other readers and had issues with them  mainly not supporting the .cbr format. Also this one works smoothest  auto rotate works great. The only thing I miss is the bookmarking... that is remembering where I left reading the comic last time. The bookmarking that is implemented I don't understand  coz it looks like bookmarking URLs (!?).,May 05 2014,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Only problem I'm having is zooming,May 02 2014,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Don't download It the worst,April 23 2014,1

net.kervala.comicsreader,I like it A little buggy. But good,April 06 2014,4
net.kervala.comicsreader,Great little app As others have mentioned it could do with a pinch zoom feature. And occasionally it backs right out of my comics folder when exiting a comic (minor gripe) But the ONE thing it could do with  is a proper screen icon  the default android icon is awful. But it's free and it works.,April 04 2014,4
