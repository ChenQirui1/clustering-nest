It was really easy to read that why i really love it .....","1":"Perfect for Nook Color After downloading failed applications for two hours  Comics Reader finally proved it can read a comic book file extension on old technology like Nook Color. This is huge to see an app like this be so backwards compatible. Keep it up guys. You have won my fandom.","2":"Fast and smooth","3":"Only can show the root folder  can not show the sub folder. The old version (V1.1) didn't have such problem","4":"Best One Ever Love it. Minor crashes but gets back up and keeps working.","5":"Another app screwed by an update","6":"Please fix the scaling problem? The latest update has a problem with scaling the images. Now  no matter what I have the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"fit to\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" option set to  I still have to manually scroll up  down  right and left to see the whole image. It doesn't seem like it  but believe me it's very annoying.\"\"","7":"I don't like the new update","8":"Scaling broken Today's update broke the scaling down to height\/width  now I need to move the image up\/down  left\/right to see all  otherwise a great reader. Hope it gets fixed soon.","9":"Comics I love this app BUT after today's update my comics won't go to full screen. They go bigger and I have to move the page atriums to read it and see the whole thing. I would rate it a 5 if it wasn't for that.","10":"Why don't u add an app icon?","11":"The best one I use it everytime I read a comic.","12":"Best comic reader I've found so far","13":"Best","14":"Can't zoom","15":"Works great but... This is nearly perfect. The one downside? It can't find comics on my SD card. If this isn't an issue for you  then it's perfect.","16":"Cannot zoom (too small) On LG G2","17":"Underrated. Prefer it to apps that are rated for other reasons: full screen page  swipe to turn page  crisp & clear  no ads. What more do you need?","18":"Nice!","19":"Clean and simple! No unneeded interface elements. Easy to configure!","20":"Lacks Pinch Zoom Seriously  it has no glitches but that's the one flaw it has: you have to change zoom through the settings. Otherwise great  legit comic reader","21":"Nice","22":"Smooth and easy Its the perfect comic\/manga reader ever","23":"Doesn't open big files I have a file that is a little bigger than 1 gb and it crashes when opening. Delete function would be cool as well.","24":"Not working","25":"Horrible Yeah right. Try better next time. You can't even zoom. Completely rubbish","26":"Almost perfect Please add zoom buttons or pinch to zoom","27":"I can't use it What's with these Comic reader Apps. I can access movies\/music\/YouTube\/ect... But I can't access Google books  aka the comics I bought and paid for. The only reason I downloaded this was so I could read the Comic like I could with the DC\/Marvel\/Dark Horse app but I guess I was asking too much.","28":"Zoom I cant zoom or the feature hasnt been added.","29":"No interface at all. Opening app just opens a file browser in the comic reader directory. There is no interface at all.","30":"Pls add zoom function","31":"5 Super","32":"I love the simple interface But it would be handy to have \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Delete\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" comics function in the app with support for deleting comics inside SD card. Also a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Zoom Pinch\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" function is much needed. I'm okay with occasional crashes.\"\"","33":"It's nice Can't zoom (need to use settings) and everytime I go to the end of a page it goes to the next page... Please fix it I'll rate it 5 when its fixed","34":"Big issues Can't zoom in\/out when reading pages are not centered.can't go to next page and sometimes it gets stuck in the middle of both pages.","35":"Kajsjs Shehe","36":"Almost there Buggy page turning  no pinch zooming. However  what is making me start looking for other is that it was reading the contents in the wrong order for this last book.","37":"Very nice This is the best one I've tried so far. The only issue is that the screen sometimes flickers as you scroll or turn pages. I can live with that.","38":"5\/5 Best comic reader i've used  doesn't crash randomly and doesn't stop showing pages randomly like other ones.","39":"Unable to access external memory Unable to access external memory","40":"Would not load past first image","41":"Loading of next page is a bit funny otherwise fine","42":"nice app","43":"Awesome app  easily used.. Would recommend it to everyone","44":"Crashfest Installed. Crashed twice. Uninstalled","45":"Lacks multi touch zoom Some comic panels require zooming in. Kindly add that feature.","46":"Amazing but needs fixing The app is amazing but after the last update  the app don't open comics anymore and closes itself. It's annoying really!!","47":"Good app I really like it. Nice  Clean simple. The no pinch To zoom is a deal breaker for me though. Perhaps in a future update? I'll try a few more apps . Maybe give this one another look at a later time..","48":"Best app to read comics Try it.","49":"I love this app I am able to search my files to find any comic book I have and read it","50":"Could be better  Need some work Would be pretty all right if there was a proper \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"pinch to zoom\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" ability  and the page turning wasn't so buggy. Also  the app seems to get attached to particular pages of a comic  and always want to resume to the same spot  even if you were much further along when you last closed the app.\"\"","51":"Cool Super fun and they have the best comics","52":"Zoom Was not able to zoom in on a frame","53":"Cool This application is awsome!","54":"Came back to this after trying ComicRack I actually tried Comic Rack (Paid version) and didn't like it  so I went back to this one. This reader has a simple interface. ComicRack's interface actually made it hard to read and enjoy a comic. Every time I tried to go to the next page  it zooms in. Although Comics Reader doesn't have a zoom function (minus 1 star)  it's fine with me. I just switched from my 7\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" tablet to my 10\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" tablet. I may try out Challenger Comics Viewer and see if it's better.\"\"","55":"Great Almost perfect. Only one issue. Doesn't work in landscape mode. Glitches and the screen pops to black on and off. Otherwise amazing app.","56":"It works Awesome","57":"Not Perfect  But Good Enough","58":"Most frustrating App does not work well at all. Doesnt find your comic files but makes you find them and sometimes doesn't even show them at all. When trying to flip a page sometimes it will flip to the same page your on a dozen times or so  fix for this is exit the app  reload it  find the comic  find the page and hope it doesn't happen again. It oftentimes will. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","59":"Clean  but missing important features Overall I like the clean UI but it is missing some important features like zooming and some basic library functionality. I'd like to set a default location for my comic files and a way to mark comic books as (un)read.","60":"Best I like this app super","61":"Gets the job done  but nothing fancy No zoom is a bit frustrating. When I create a bookmark and then later try to use the bookmark to go back to where I was  it crashes. If I go to a different app and then later go back to this one  it starts from the beginning like I opened the file for the first time. Might need to look for a better comic reader... Just found Challenger Comics Viewer....much better. Truth.","62":"Can't zoom","63":"Has potential Touch sensitivity is awful  lack of options  no zoom.","64":"Sux Uninstalled","65":"Can't zoom Why can't you zoom in  some text can hardly be seen and its worse on a duble page. It's the only problem I have come across but its kinda a biggie As it means having to read those pages on another comic reader that can zoom but crashes every other page.","66":"It works. Didn't care for it all that much though. Wasnt very touch sensitive. Had to try 2 or 3 times to get it to respond. Note 2.","67":"Not working When I select the comic the screen goes right back to my book list.","68":"Great app Doesn't mess around  just does what it should  no problems.","69":"Worth it if comic lover","70":"Good app. Would like pinch and zoom though","71":"Awesome app! Overall pretty good app. Has alot of awesome settings. Would love to see double tap and pinch to zoom features and some improvements on the UI: like a book self and a recently books read list etc. But even now i believe its better from the most paid readers and all of the free ones!! Will give it 5 if some of the features i mention going to be added later on :)","72":"Good App! Overall a good app. Nice compatibility with different book file types. User interface could be a bit better. Reminds a little of the older days with dos but it works. I can read my DeadPool Comics and D&D books. Keep it up!","73":"Add zoom..","74":"Comics reader Works. Thanks! Pinch for zoom and support for pdf files would be very nice to add.","75":"No ads  smooth  works great!","76":"What the..!?! Cannot browse to the file location... It opens up from the very beginning then I try to browse the sd card but it doesn't show the folder not the folder holding the comics... Do fix please...","77":"Zoom feature please","78":"Works Nexus 7 Yepp finally found a reader that works on a first gen nexus reading Thor comics now...","79":"it was working great up untill it was working great up untill the last 2 updates now it won't even open the files.","80":"5 stars Easy to use","81":"Doesnt work","82":"One of the best!!! Certainly  given its small size and ease of use i must say its one of the most bestest apps out there and i will surely give it a five star rating if u add a pinch zoom feature in it! Thanx!","83":"The new update made some of my front covers become the last page instead in most of my comics.","84":"Excellent","85":"Not sure If I read description wrong but I wasn't able to read any comics because it kept making me choose a file","86":"Its Good Although it would be usefull if I was able to save pages.","87":"Just confusing Could not open any cbr files  no matter where I located them. Search function was pointlessly cluttered.","88":"Great app to read comics  it's very intuitive to use.","89":"Doesn't zoom How can you not allow for zoom?","90":"Great","91":"Get comic books Where can I get the free comic books at?","92":"this is really good i just wish there was a way to mark stuff as read.","93":"Needs a better zoom system.","94":"Rubbish Complete useless","95":"Non user friendly Opened it up  was confronted with a bunch of my file folders  none of which contained the file I needed opened. If I have to work for it  I'm going elsewhere.","96":"No zoom No zoom.","97":"Great reader This really is a good reader. I've tried 3 other readers and had issues with them  mainly not supporting the .cbr format. Also this one works smoothest  auto rotate works great. The only thing I miss is the bookmarking... that is remembering where I left reading the comic last time. The bookmarking that is implemented I don't understand  coz it looks like bookmarking URLs (!?).","98":"Only problem I'm having is zooming","99":"Don't download It the worst","100":"I go storage\/emulated\/0\/ and look for the downloads folder only to find its not there. What's up with that? My file manager finds it just fine. Useless app for me.","101":"Crap It always crashes","102":"I like it A little buggy. But good","103":"Great little app As others have mentioned it could do with a pinch zoom feature. And occasionally it backs right out of my comics folder when exiting a comic (minor gripe) But the ONE thing it could do with  is a proper screen icon  the default android icon is awful. But it's free and it works.","104":"It's ok does not zoom It's ok does not zoom on my galaxy S 4 makes it really hard to read need a magnifying glass to read comic   make it zoom and I will give it 4 stars...","105":"Is Chromecast possible?","106":"Crashed Every time I open my download directory it crashes. Cyanogen 10 stable. Still  3 stars for gplv3 and minimal permissions. Thank you!"},"date":{"0":"November 06 2016","1":"November 05 2016","2":"September 24 2016","3":"August 30 2016","4":"August 28 2016","5":"August 25 2016","6":"April 13 2016","7":"April 12 2016","8":"April 12 2016","9":"April 12 2016","10":"April 11 2016","11":"April 11 2016","12":"March 10 2016","13":"February 24 2016","14":"February 09 2016","15":"January 25 2016","16":"January 20 2016","17":"January 16 2016","18":"January 15 2016","19":"January 09 2016","20":"December 03 2015","21":"November 14 2015","22":"November 14 2015","23":"November 07 2015","24":"November 03 2015","25":"September 27 2015","26":"September 22 2015","27":"September 12 2015","28":"September 03 2015","29":"September 02 2015","30":"August 16 2015","31":"July 22 2015","32":"July 18 2015","33":"July 13 2015","34":"July 06 2015","35":"June 18 2015","36":"June 17 2015","37":"June 13 2015","38":"June 04 2015","39":"April 25 2015","40":"April 13 2015","41":"April 03 2015","42":"March 28 2015","43":"March 20 2015","44":"March 13 2015","45":"February 17 2015","46":"February 04 2015","47":"January 30 2015","48":"January 13 2015","49":"January 11 2015","50":"January 09 2015","51":"January 02 2015","52":"December 25 2014","53":"December 16 2014","54":"November 21 2014","55":"November 19 2014","56":"October 30 2014","57":"September 08 2014","58":"September 08 2014","59":"September 03 2014","60":"August 31 2014","61":"August 28 2014","62":"August 24 2014","63":"August 21 2014","64":"August 19 2014","65":"August 10 2014","66":"August 09 2014","67":"August 05 2014","68":"August 03 2014","69":"July 27 2014","70":"July 23 2014","71":"July 21 2014","72":"July 20 2014","73":"July 19 2014","74":"July 14 2014","75":"July 13 2014","76":"July 02 2014","77":"July 02 2014","78":"July 01 2014","79":"June 30 2014","80":"June 30 2014","81":"June 30 2014","82":"June 24 2014","83":"June 22 2014","84":"June 22 2014","85":"June 20 2014","86":"June 19 2014","87":"June 06 2014","88":"June 03 2014","89":"June 03 2014","90":"June 02 2014","91":"May 25 2014","92":"May 25 2014","93":"May 23 2014","94":"May 12 2014","95":"May 11 2014","96":"May 08 2014","97":"May 05 2014","98":"May 02 2014","99":"April 23 2014","100":"April 14 2014","101":"April 07 2014","102":"April 06 2014","103":"April 04 2014","104":"April 02 2014","105":"March 24 2014","106":"March 16 2014"},"star":{"0":5,"1":5,"2":4,"3":1,"4":5,"5":1,"6":3,"7":1,"8":3,"9":3,"10":4,"11":5,"12":4,"13":5,"14":3,"15":4,"16":3,"17":5,"18":5,"19":5,"20":4,"21":5,"22":5,"23":4,"24":1,"25":1,"26":4,"27":2,"28":5,"29":1,"30":3,"31":5,"32":4,"33":3,"34":2,"35":5,"36":2,"37":5,"38":5,"39":2,"40":1,"41":4,"42":5,"43":5,"44":1,"45":3,"46":1,"47":3,"48":5,"49":5,"50":2,"51":4,"52":1,"53":4,"54":4,"55":4,"56":5,"57":4,"58":1,"59":2,"60":5,"61":3,"62":1,"63":2,"64":1,"65":3,"66":2,"67":1,"68":5,"69":4,"70":3,"71":4,"72":4,"73":3,"74":4,"75":4,"76":2,"77":2,"78":5,"79":1,"80":5,"81":1,"82":4,"83":3,"84":5,"85":2,"86":4,"87":1,"88":5,"89":1,"90":5,"91":5,"92":4,"93":1,"94":1,"95":1,"96":2,"97":4,"98":4,"99":1,"100":2,"101":1,"102":4,"103":4,"104":2,"105":5,"106":3}}
